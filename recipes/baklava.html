    <h2>Description</h2>

        you'll probably like Baklava.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>½ (16 ounce) package phyllo dough</li>
        <li>2 cups chopped pecans</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons whole cloves</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
        <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>1 cup honey</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Melt the butter over low heat. Pour 2 tablespoons of the butter into the bottom
            of a 9x13 inch baking pan. Layer 3 sheets of the phyllo dough in the pan. Trim
            dough to fit. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of pecans over the phyllo dough. Layer 3
            more sheets of dough, brush generously with the melted butter, and sprinkle with
            2 tablespoons of pecans. Continue dough -butter- pecan layers until pan is 3/4 full.</li>
        <li>With a sharp knife, score phyllo dough to form diamonds. Press a clove at each end
            of the diamonds. Pour remaining butter over the dough.</li>
        <li>Bake 45 to 50 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine the sugar, water and cinnamon stick in a medium saucepan, and
            bring to boil, stirring constantly. Simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the honey and simmer for 2 minutes longer. Remove from heat and discard cinnamon
            stick. Pour honey mixture over hot baklava. Let cool on wire racks. Cut into diamonds.</li>
