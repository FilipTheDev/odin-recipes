    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a great meal for any chicken meat lovers. It has a great taste,
        it makes you full and has a lot of protein. It's very simple to make
        so anyone can do it and it tastes fine. If you have kids the chicken cubes
        are small so kids don't need a knife to cut the steak and they can eat it
        just as it is.
